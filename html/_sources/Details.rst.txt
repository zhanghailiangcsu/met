The parameter details for DIASim
-----------------------------------------

  | **Files.** The input file(.xlsx) of DIASim that contains SMILES, retention times and intensitise.
    SMILES are the components that need to be simulated.
    The retention times can be set by yourself, or it can be predicted by algorithms such as GNN-RT.
    Intensities represents the component intensities that need to be simulated

  | **Npeaks.** The number of peaks to include in the isotopic cluster, starting from the monoisotopic peak. 
    If given a number below 1 or above the maximum number of isotopic variants, the maximum will be used. 

  | **Energy.** Collision energies simulated in the DIA runs. 
    CFMID can simulate the fragmentation of components at three collision energies, namely high energy, medium energy and low energy, and the corresponding collision energies are 10eV, 20eV and 40eV.
    When using DIASim, you need to manually select a suitable collision energy from three energies. 

  | **NoiseIntensity.** The noise intensity added during simulation can be set according to the intensity of the input file or the noise of the instrument. 

  | **NoiseDensity.** NoiseDensity stands for density factor. The higher the density factor, the more white noise there is in each spectrum. 
    The noiseDensity is 1 represents that the number of noise peaks in the unit m/z is 1.

  | **Rate.** Rate represents the acquisition rate of the mass spectrometry instrument. In other words, rate is the time interval between mass spectrum acquisitions in seconds. 

  | **IsolationWindowSize.** Unlike data dependent acquisition(DDA) technology, DIA has wider isolation windows. IsolationWindowSize represents the isolation window size needs to be set during simulation

  | **IsolationWindowNumber.** DIA acquires MS/MS of precursor ions within multiple adjacent isolation windows independent of precursor ions intensities. 
    Therefore, you need to set the number of windows during simulation. 

  | **Mz_start.** Mz_start represents the the m/z at the start of the acquisition of the isolation window based on actual experiments. 

  | **RT.** RT is the retention time in seconds.

  | **Mz_tol.** Mz_tol represents m/z tolerance in simulated DIA runs. Since DIA uses a wide isolation window, the MS/MS is a complex mixture of spectra and there are commom fragment ions. 
    Using m/z tolerance can define whether two peaks are sufficiently close to be overlapping or not. The intensities of the peaks to be merged are summed, 
    and the new m/z value is calculated by a weighted average of the original m/z values weighted by the intensities of the respective peaks.and this parameter is adjustable by the user. 

  | **Save.** Save represents the storage location of the output file(.mzML).
